# Happy New Year!

Hello, I made this small project when I was learning Javascript at [Adalab](https://github.com/Adalab) in order to practice Asynchrony and timers (but also JS as a whole and of course CSS and HTML).

I'm Spain where I'm from there's a tradition of eating grapes in the last seconds of the year while the bells are ringing, one grape per chime. People watch in on TV or listen to it on the radio to know when they need to start eating the next grape. This app mimics the images shown on television with that purpose.

Hope you like my page, you can find it [here](https://andreaaguado.github.io/happy-new-year/)
