# Happy New Year!

Hello, I made this small project when I was learning Javascript at [Adalab](https://github.com/Adalab) in order to practice Asynchrony and timers.

I'm Spain where I'm from there's a tradition of eating grapes in the last seconds of the year while the bells are ringing, one grape per chime. People watch in on TV to know when they need to start eating the next grape. This app mimics the images shown on television with that purpose.
